        Rabindranath Tagore FRAS was a Bengali poet, writer, composer,
        philosopher and painter. He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as
        well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early
        20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful
        verse" of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European as well as
        the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

        agore despised rote classroom schooling: in "The Parrot's Training", a
        bird is caged and force-fed textbook pagesâ€”to death.Tagore, visiting
        Santa Barbara in 1917, conceived a new type of university: he sought to
        "make Santiniketan the connecting thread between India and the world
        [and] a world center for the study of humanity somewhere beyond the
        limits of nation and geography."On 25 March 2004, Tagore's Nobel Prize
        was stolen from the safety vault of the Visva-Bharati University, along
        with several other of his belongings.Every year, many events pay tribute
        to Tagore: Kabipranam, his birth anniversary, is celebrated by groups
        scattered across the globe; the annual Tagore Festival held in Urbana,
        Illinois (USA); Rabindra Path Parikrama walking pilgrimages from Kolkata
        to Santiniketan; and recitals of his poetry, which are held on important
        anniversaries.
